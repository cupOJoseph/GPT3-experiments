The Auction house

“Next lot, planet ERT-5465937, orbits a single star, average rotation time within 4% of a standard Gorbukle Orbital. It was last cataloged 72 GO’s ago, where it was confirmed to be over 30,000 simple fish species. Records also indicate a dominant nonspace-faring civilization, engaged in multi continental war, that we expect to be extinct by now. The planet is colloquially known as Earth. We start the bidding at 12 GC’s.”

Arrlt wrote notes in the air in front of him on his virtual pad with one of his 36 long boney fingers. 30,000 simple aquatic creatures, wow! If he could score this for less than 50 Gorbukle Credits he would definitely get that promotion he’d been hoping for. All of his hearts beat fast as he raised his appendage to indicate he would bid on the planet. He had been passed on for the last promotion to Senior Fish Wrangler, and the sting of his boss choosing a more junior colleague still stung. I must win this lot, Arrlt told himself.

“12 GC’s, do I see 15? I have 12 looking for 15? 30,000 simple fish species as last surveyed, do I have 14? 14! Do I have 15 from the crowd?” The auctioneer projected, his gurgles being instantly translated into hundreds of languages and dialects by the bots in each assembled creatures’ ears or sound receptors. Arrlt bid the 15, and then 20, and then 35. He started to get nervous when the bidding reached 40 Gorbukle Credits and a grumpy looking Endorean that he was mainly bidding against started eying him closely. The Endorean stood on its floating orb of a chair and shouted, “41GC’s and not a credit more!” Arrlt calmly bid 42. He knew the lot was his and started making preparations to visit the planet when the defeated Endorean whisked himself out of the room on his orb.

Earth

When Arrlt first arrived on the planet, he was not prepared for the environmental factors that Earth presented. After he had donned his breather mask, he ventured out of his airship and looked around.

"My fishies, my fishies!" He called out, knowing they would hear his sonic voice. But he could not see any fish. All he saw were water covered mountains, rolling hills of grass, and forests of enormous trees. He could not see any oceans, lakes, rivers, or streams, or any bodies of water at all. He looked down at his virtual pad to check his position and noticed he was at the exact coordinates where the original survey had indicated the largest ocean to be. He started walking down the hill towards the ocean, looking for a way to get into the water. As he got closer, he could see the trees in the distance, but the forest had not grown on this part of the planet. He looked back up at the ocean.

"Why can't I see any fish? Where are my fishies?"

Arrlt heard a voice from the woods and looked around. He could not see anyone or anything in the forest. He heard the voice again, "Are you looking for fish?" Arrlt turned around and looked at the trees. He heard the voice again, "I can help you find some fish, if you like." Arrlt was surprised to see a tall figure emerge from the trees. It was a humanoid with a thin body, long arms, and long legs. It had a head with no eyes, ears, or nose, just a mouth with a smiling face.

"You can talk?" Arrlt asked, "And you can see?"

"Yes, yes, and yes," the humanoid said. "My name is Scott, what is your name?"

"I am Arrlt, I am from planet Fishfright, I am here to find some fish."

"You have come to the right place, Arrlt, there are plenty of fish here," Scott said, smiling his big smile. "I can help you find them."

"But I am looking for 30,000 simple fish species, as last surveyed.
